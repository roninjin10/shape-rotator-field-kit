# AGENTS.md

Instructions for LLM agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Claude Desktop,
raw DSPy / LangGraph / anything) that want to *use* the shape-rotator
tools from any working directory on this machine.

## How to find this file from anywhere

If the operator has run `./kit install-global`, two environment
variables are available in every shell:

```
$SHAPE_ROTATOR_KIT_PATH         absolute path to the kit root
$SHAPE_ROTATOR_KIT_AGENTS_MD    absolute path to THIS file
```

An agent not already working inside this repo should check those env
vars first. If they're set, read `$SHAPE_ROTATOR_KIT_AGENTS_MD` for tool
usage, then invoke tools via the `rotate` binary (also on PATH after
install-global). `shape-rotator-kit` is an alias for the same thing.

If those env vars are not set, fall back to asking the user where the
kit lives, or skip these tools for now.

## What this repo is

A pinned bundle of small, local-first tools for the **shape rotator
program**. Each tool lives in its own git repo and is included here as
a submodule pinned to a specific commit. The kit is stable; individual
tools are updated by bumping their submodule pointer.

When you clone and work on something in this repo, you're usually
working *inside* one of the submodules. Respect each submodule's own
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` for its conventions. This file
is the monorepo-level overview.

## Calling tools globally

After `./kit install-global`, every tool is invokable from anywhere:

```bash
rotate research "question"       # DSPy research agent
rotate vox                       # voice transcription TUI
rotate doctor                    # health check
rotate update                    # bump submodule pins
rotate help                      # full command list
```

`shape-rotator-kit` is an alias for `rotate` if you prefer the explicit
name. Extra args pass through, e.g. `rotate research --parallel "..."`.

## Setup (run once)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dmarzzz/shape-rotator-field-kit.git
cd shape-rotator-field-kit

# If you forgot --recurse-submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## The tools

### `skills/` — Claude Code skills for cohort workflows

- **What it is:** a directory of `<name>/SKILL.md` files Claude Code can
  invoke as `/<name>`. Currently shipped:
  - `shape-rotator-profile` — interactive add/update of the user's
    cohort person record in `dmarzzz/shape-rotator-os`, ending
    in a PR. Walks them through the schema, finds their existing entry
    if any, preserves fields the user doesn't touch.
  - `matrix-bot-setup` — register the user's local agent on the cohort
    Matrix server. Currently a stub (homeserver + room IDs pending).
- **Install:** `rotate install-skills` symlinks each `skills/<name>/`
  into `~/.claude/skills/`. After that, invoke them via `/<name>` from
  Claude Code.
- **What NOT to do:** don't hand-roll PR scripts when the user wants to
  update their profile — invoke `/shape-rotator-profile` so the schema
  + sensitivity rules are applied uniformly. Don't add Matrix glue
  outside the `matrix-bot-setup` skill yet — wait for the operator to
  supply homeserver details.

### `Shape Rotator OS` Electron app

- **What it is:** the cohort participant viewer / profile editor —
  separate repo (`dmarzzz/shape-rotator-os`), shipped as
  signed-by-no-one DMG / deb / exe.
- **Install:** `rotate install-app` downloads the latest release for
  the current platform, copies it into `/Applications` (mac) or
  installs via `dpkg` (linux), and clears the macOS quarantine flag
  so Gatekeeper doesn't refuse to open the unsigned bundle.
- **Manual path:** if `rotate install-app` doesn't fit (Windows, custom
  prefix, etc.), grab the dmg/exe/deb from
  <https://github.com/dmarzzz/shape-rotator-os/releases/latest>.
  On macOS only: after copying to /Applications, run
  `xattr -cr "/Applications/Shape Rotator OS.app"` to clear the
  quarantine bit. Without it, Gatekeeper will refuse to open the app
  with a misleading "is damaged and can't be opened" error.

### `research-swarm/` — DSPy ReAct research agent

- **Use when:** the user needs a grounded, cited answer to an open
  research question, or a literature survey, or a "explain X and
  compare it to Y" kind of ask.
- **What it does:** picks tools (web / arXiv / GitHub / fetch / ...)
  across a ReAct loop until it has enough to write a synthesis with
  inline citations. Every page it reads goes into `~/world_knowledge/`
  and an SQLite FTS5 index, so adjacent queries later go faster and
  answer from material it already trusts.
- **Quickest run:**
  ```bash
  cd research-swarm
  python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -e .
  cp .env.example .env                  # set LM_MODEL or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  research-agent "your question"
  ```
- **Modes:** `research-agent "q"` (single ReAct loop) or
  `research-agent --parallel "q"` (STORM decompose-fan-out-merge).
- **Library use (for your own agent):**
  ```python
  from research_agent.tools import web_search, local_search, fetch_url, arxiv_search
  # use these as tools in your own DSPy / LangGraph / whatever loop
  ```
- **What NOT to do:** don't invoke the whole `research-agent` CLI for
  one-shot web fetches; import `fetch_url` directly. Don't hit external
  search APIs that need paid keys (Tavily, Brave API, Exa) — the design
  principle is no paid intermediaries.

### `voxterm/` — local voice transcription TUI

- **Use when:** the user wants a real-time transcript of a meeting,
  conversation, or solo talk-out. Works fully offline.
- **What it does:** captures mic audio locally, transcribes in real
  time with speaker diarization, writes a markdown transcript to
  `~/Documents/voxterm-transcripts/`. No audio is stored. Voice
  profiles live encrypted in macOS Keychain. P2P mode shares a
  transcript stream across devices on the same LAN.
- **Requires:** macOS with Apple Silicon (M1+) and Python 3.9+.
- **Quickest install (recommended):**
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmarzzz/VoxTerm/main/install.sh | bash
  voxterm
  ```
- **In-app hotkeys of note:** `P` for party / LAN P2P mode; `H` for
  hive-mind-style aggregate sharing; see voxterm's own README for the
  full set.
- **What NOT to do:** don't spin up a cloud transcription service for
  the same task. This tool is the cloud replacement.

### `content-pipeline/` — source → blog + tweet thread + explainer video

- **Use when:** the user has produced something worth publishing
  (a research-swarm run, a voxterm transcript, a draft markdown
  document) and wants any subset of: a blog post, a tweet thread,
  a self-contained animated explainer video.
- **What it does:** runs a small orchestrator that materializes a
  canonical `source.md` from whatever input kind you have, snapshots
  the exact prompts + aesthetic used by this run into the run folder
  for reproducibility, and emits a `NEXT.md` that tells an LLM agent
  which prompt to execute with which paths to get each output.
- **Pluggable:** formats live under `content-pipeline/formats/`, input
  adapters under `adapters/`, voice/style overrides under `aesthetic/`.
  Add a format by creating a new subdir with a `prompt.md`.
- **Aesthetic:** personal voice/style files under `aesthetic/` (other
  than `default.yaml`) are gitignored. The pipeline will never
  accidentally push someone's personal voice profile into a PR.
- **Quickest run from the field-kit root:**
  ```bash
  rotate content --trace ~/Flashbots/.../runs/20260422-X.json
  rotate content --transcript ~/Documents/voxterm-transcripts/2026-04-22.md
  rotate content --markdown notes.md --formats blog
  ```
- **Outputs land in** `content-pipeline/output/<date>-<slug>/`. That
  folder is gitignored; nothing from a real run leaks into a PR.
- **What NOT to do:** don't commit anything under `output/`. Don't
  edit `aesthetic/default.yaml` for personal taste; copy it to
  `aesthetic/<your-handle>.yaml` and edit that.

## Using tools together

These tools are designed to compose. Some common patterns:

- **Research → publish:** `rotate research "..."` runs the agent; the
  run log in `research-swarm/runs/*.json` is a research trace. Feed
  that trace to `rotate content --trace runs/<file>.json` to produce
  a blog post, a tweet thread, and an explainer video.
- **Voice → publish:** `rotate vox` produces a transcript in
  `~/Documents/voxterm-transcripts/`. Feed that to
  `rotate content --transcript ~/Documents/voxterm-transcripts/<file>.md`
  for the same trio of outputs.
- **Notes → publish:** hand-written markdown also works via
  `rotate content --markdown notes.md`.
- **Cumulative archive:** every research-swarm run adds to
  `~/world_knowledge/`. Transcripts land in
  `~/Documents/voxterm-transcripts/`. Content-pipeline runs land in
  `content-pipeline/output/<date>-<slug>/`. All three are searchable
  locally; nothing leaves your machine unless you publish it.
- **Offline friendly:** voxterm is fully offline. research-swarm with
  an Ollama LM + an empty query cache still wants network the first
  time, but answers locally thereafter. content-pipeline itself is
  offline; only your agent's underlying LM might hit the network.

## Tool Exchange (cohort-contributed tools)

The [`tool-exchange/`](./tool-exchange) directory is the open catalog
of tools the program cohort is sharing. This is **not** the same as
the pinned submodules at the root; those are the three curated tools
the kit ships. Tool Exchange is everything else anyone in the cohort
has brought.

Structure:

- [`tool-exchange/submissions/<slug>.md`](./tool-exchange/submissions)
  — one markdown file per tool. Follows
  [`tool-exchange/TEMPLATE.md`](./tool-exchange/TEMPLATE.md). New
  submissions arrive as PRs.
- [`tool-exchange/workshop/`](./tool-exchange/workshop) — a 4-session
  workshop series (week of May 4-8) where submitters demo, attendees
  dogfood live, and promising tools may get promoted to the kit proper.
  Signups live in [`workshop/signups.md`](./tool-exchange/workshop/signups.md);
  slides land in [`workshop/slides.html`](./tool-exchange/workshop/slides.html)
  when ready.

An agent helping a user contribute should:

1. Copy `tool-exchange/TEMPLATE.md` to
   `tool-exchange/submissions/<user-tool-slug>.md`.
2. Fill it in based on the user's actual tool (ask questions rather
   than hallucinate install commands or platform support).
3. Open a PR titled `tool-exchange: add <tool-name>`.

If the user is asking about "what's out there" during the program,
`ls tool-exchange/submissions/` is the quick answer.

## Environment assumptions

- Python 3.12 recommended (3.10+ will also work for research-swarm;
  voxterm needs 3.9+).
- macOS is the first-class target. Linux works for research-swarm.
  voxterm's speaker diarization is Apple-Silicon-optimized.
- No tool in this kit requires a cloud account to run. API keys are
  grudging exceptions where a provider is the only reasonable path
  (GitHub for higher rate limits, Anthropic/OpenAI if you prefer a
  hosted LM). Ollama is always a valid free fallback.

## When to update a submodule

```bash
cd research-swarm
git checkout main
git pull
cd ..
git add research-swarm
git commit -m "bump research-swarm to <new SHA>"
git push
```

Same shape for any other submodule. The kit pins a specific SHA so
workshop attendees get a reproducible stack; bumps are explicit.
